# Your friendly IT helper

Ask is a simple command line script that makes a gpt call.

```bash
ask how do I send a git repo to github
```

It's aware of your system settings and can answer questions about those.

```bash
ask what is my GPU
```

It's preferred to wrap your request (and anything you paste) in double quotes.

```bash
ask "where are my samba config settings"
```

Default model is GPT3.5, which is more than capable of basic syntax questions. If you are not getting a satisfactory answer, escalate to the manager (gpt4o).

```bash
ask escalate
```
