[34mThe `lost+found` directory is a special directory that is automatically created on Linux file systems when they are formatted.[0m

[34mThis directory serves a specific purpose in the event of a file system error or corruption. Here's what it's for:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **File System Consistency Checking**: When you run a file system check tool, such as `fsck` [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfile system check[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m, it may discover orphaned or lost files on the file[0m
[34msystem. These are files that do not have a directory entry pointing to them, typically due to a system crash or power failure.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Recovering Orphaned Files**: The `lost+found` directory is used to store these orphaned files that are discovered during the file system check. The file system [0m
[34mcheck tool will attempt to recover these files and place them in the `lost+found` directory.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Maintaining File System Integrity**: By having a `lost+found` directory, the file system can maintain its integrity by safely storing any recovered files, rather[0m
[34mthan potentially losing important data.[0m

[34mThe contents of the `lost+found` directory are typically not very useful to the average user, as the recovered files may not have meaningful names or be in a usable [0m
[34mstate. However, it's an important feature of the file system for maintaining data integrity and recoverability in the event of system failures or file system errors.[0m

[34mYou don't need to do anything with the `lost+found` directory unless you are specifically trying to recover files from a file system error. It's completely normal for[0m
[34mit to exist on your newly formatted `nvme1n1` drive.[0m
